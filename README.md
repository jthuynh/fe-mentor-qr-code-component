## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Initially, I intended to use flexbox on the contents of the card in order to align everything vertically, but I ran into a spacing issue with the QR code. Instead, I went with the CSS grid to automatically space out the content.
